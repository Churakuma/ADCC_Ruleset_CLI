# ADCC_Ruleset_CLI
CLI application that allows the user to view the ruleset of the [ADCC Submission Fighting Tournaments](https://adcombat.com/adcc-rules-regulations/adcc-rules-for-beginners-intermediate/) and figure out their weight class and division.

## Technologies
- [Python](https://www.python.org/)
- [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html)
- [DB Browser for SQLite](https://sqlitebrowser.org/)



## Installation
1. Clone the Repository
```
git clone https://github.com/Churakuma/ADCC_Ruleset_CLI.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory where it has been cloned
```
cd repository_location\
```

3. Run the ruleset.py file
```
Python3 ruleset.py
```

## Usage
Once you have run the program you will be asked for some simple information such as below.

</p>

From here, the program will display what weightclass you should be eligible for given the information you have input and will display the General rules of the competition as well as a list of illegal moves you are not allowed to perform based on your skill level.

## Further Enhancements
I am looking to build upon this application further by refining the way it interacts with the SQL database as well as looking at making it store competitor data that can then later show and analyse data as well regarding the competition such as submission rates, takedown/win rates etc.

## Contribution
If you find any issues or have suggestions for improvement, feel free to create an issue or submit a pull request. This was a simple project I started to experiment further and develop my understanding of Python CLI applications.

Thank you for using my ADCC Ruleset Generator! If you have any questions or require further clarification, please reach out!

## Disclaimer
This application is by no means associated with ADCC and is simply a fun little side project.
